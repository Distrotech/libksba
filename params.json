Both\r\nspecifications are building blocks of S/MIME and TLS.\r\n\r\nIn the first step we will concentrate on providing the profile\r\nrequired by the Aegypten project (i.e. the MailTrusT based BSI profile\r\nfor SPHINX).  However, the architecture will be flexible enough to\r\neasily support other profiles too.\r\n\r\nKSBA will be made available as a standard shared library and reserves\r\nidentifiers starting with \"ksba\" and \"_ksba\" (also uppercase and mixed\r\ncase).  It does not rely on another cryptographic library but will\r\nprovide hooks for easy integration with Libgcrypt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Documentation\r\n                            -------------\r\n\r\nA standard info format reference manual is included.  However the OCSP\r\nfeature has not yet been documented.  See the comments in src/ocsp.c\r\nand the example tests/t-ocsp.c.  The package gnupg part dirmngr makes\r\nextensive use of the ocsp feature and may be used as another example.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
